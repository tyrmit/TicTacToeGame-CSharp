# TicTacToeGame-CSharp
Simple C# implementation of a Tic Tac Toe game in the console

### Steps to run
- Clone the repository and open in Visual Studio (.NET 5.0+)
- Run the code
- That's it!

### What the game does
The game will display a 3x3 grid in the console and prompt player 1 to choose a square. It will alternate between player 1 and 2 until either a player has won or it's a draw. If you enter anything that is not a number or a number that is already taken, you will get an error alert and prompted to choose again. Once a game is complete (either from a win or a draw), the game will reset and you can start playing again from the start.
